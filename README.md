# AGNI-Network 
This project is a collaboration by UCSC Students as part of the Reboot Earth 2025 hackathon. The name AGNI is inspired by the Hindu God of Fire, Agni. It is a fitting title since the first Reboot Hackathon was held in India. This dashboard is designed to aggregate data from various sources and create a visual map of California color coded by fire risk areas. Additionally, there is an AI agent that has been incorporated into the dashboard that can make recommendations to fire departments based on data points to initiate control burns or other fire management techniques as well as answer questions about fire risk by area. This tool is designed with first responders in mind to help assist in fire prevention and management by giving fire departments a proactive tool. While we have chosen to start with California first, this network is scalable to other states and countries, allowing fire professionals around the world to have an edge in proactive fire prevention.
